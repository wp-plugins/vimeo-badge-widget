== Description ==

Displays a badge of recent vimeo videos. Can pull recent videos from a user, group, album or channel.

One thing to note is that Vimeo is not always perfect and sometimes does not have a thumbnail for a given video.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `vimeo-badge-widget` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Widgets and add it to your sidebar!
4. Do NOT enter the entire Vimeo URL. Just enter the part of the URL that matches with 'ENTER_THIS' (I hope to make this more intuitive in the future)
